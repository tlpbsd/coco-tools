- Support for two color images (I don't have any to test!)

- Some VEFs contain 8 padded lines at the top that get cropped out by display
  programs (as I understand it.) It would be nice to detect these reliably and
remove them, if possible.

- CoCo 3 palette should probably be verified accurate, but it looks correct.
